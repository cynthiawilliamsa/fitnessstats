Fitness Stats App

This is a full stack tracking app for personal trainers and their clients.  Currently the app provides the following:

Landing: A snapshot view of the user's most recent stats entered.
New Entry: A form that allowed user to enter a new set of stats.
Progress: Displays all user entries.  Upon click of date, a modal pops up to provide detail stats entered for that date.


Build Tools / Stack
React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Material-UI

App written in React.js.
MongoDB (through MLAB) database for storing user info and statistics.
Express.js use for server.

Future Plans: 
Implement Authentication
Implement Redux for state management as app complexity progesses.
Create mobile app
Setup for multiple users
Improve UI
Using D3.js, plan to show user progress data in more detail (ie. bodyfat metric and how they compare to healthy ranges for age/gender).
